# Objective-C
Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language that extends the C language with Smalltalk-style messaging, allowing for dynamic runtime capabilities and flexible, powerful coding paradigms. It was the primary language used by Apple for iOS and macOS development before Swift's introduction in 2014. Key features include categories for adding methods to existing classes, protocols for defining methods that can be implemented by any class, and properties for simplifying getter and setter methods. Despite being largely replaced by Swift, Objective-C remains important for understanding and maintaining legacy Apple software.
